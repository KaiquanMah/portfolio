      <header>
        <h2>Hi, I am Kai</h2>
        <p>I have 9 years of experience solving problems hands-on for companies in the Financial Services and Public Services industry.
           I have worked on topics such as data, analytics and helping companies through change, through both short term projects lasting one to a few months, and long-term projects lasting one to two years.
           Depending on projects I worked on, the stakeholders I had to align with range from a small team to multiple business and technology workstreams.
           Over the course of my work from Singapore, I have also worked with people from Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India, the Philippines, Japan), Europe (Finland, UK) and the United States.
           I am looking to help companies understand data science use cases and implement these solutions to solve business problems.</p>

          <h3>2. Rocket Academy Basics</h3>
          <p>
             I completed the Rocket Academy Basics training from February to April 2022 to improve my computational thinking using JavaScript.
             We has pre-class readings and practices, lectures and in-class practices where we practised pair programming with a fellow classmate.
             We also completed some short projects on our own, and reached out to our instructors or fellow classmates if we needed help.
             These projects include:
              <ol>
                  <li>Scissors, Paper Stone - Single-player game against the computer. The intention of this assignment was to become comfortable with writing if-else statements in JavaScript and refactoring code into smaller, maintainable functions. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project1-sps/script.js" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href="https://kaiquanmah.github.io/basics-14-real/project1-sps/index.html" target="_blank">webpage</a></li>
                  <li>Beat That - Two-player game where each player has 2 random dice rolls, choose their first and second numbers, then compare which player's number is the highest. The intention of this assignment was to become more comfortable working with mutable (let) and immutable (const) variables, and continue practising on if-else statements. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project2-beat-that/script.js" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href="https://kaiquanmah.github.io/basics-14-real/project2-beat-that/index.html" target="_blank">webpage</a></li>
                  <li>Blackjack - Single-player game against the computer. The intention of this assignment was to become more comfortable working with (1) customising for different stages/modes of a game based on a user's action, (2) showing relevant buttons during the game, (3) customising the background colour, font and adding images. Refer to the code (<a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project3-blackjack/index.html" target="_blank">HTML</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project3-blackjack/styles.css" target="_blank">CSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project3-blackjack/script.js" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>) and <a href="https://kaiquanmah.github.io/basics-14-real/project3-blackjack/index.html" target="_blank">webpage</a></li>

          <h3>3. DataCamp Data Analyst Case Study</h3>
          <p>
             As part of the DataCamp Data Analyst certification assessment, I completed an interesting case study to increase readership by 75% in 1 year for the marketing department of a fictitious company - 'Nearly New Nautical'.
             This was a case study with analysis performed using Python in a Jupyter notebook, a slide deck and a recorded presentation (accessible only by the DataCamp assessors).
             The case study was interesting as I got a glimpse into the different boat designs while creating the slide deck.
             Please reach out to me personally (links are available at the end of this page) if you would like to view the Jupyter notebook analysis and slide deck.

                    My first two years at Accenture was with the Wealth Management arm of a Banking client. My focus was on project management, data cleaning, data analysis,

                    Beyond client work, my project supervisor gave me opportunities to help out at the client account level and with the Singapore Financial Services practice. 
                    I was also given the chance to organise and prepare event logistics when organising events for the Accenture team on the project, besides chasing the team for time sheets every week and helping out with onboarding Accenture new joiners on the project. 
                    I loved the guidance and autonomy my supervisor provided me during those two years
