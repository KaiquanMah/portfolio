          <h3>Specialist - Accenture - Singapore</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Specialist (Jun 2021 – Present)</li>
            <li>Senior Analyst (Jan 2019 – May 2021)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    My first two years at Accenture was with the Wealth Management arm of a Banking client. My focus was on project management, data cleaning, data analysis,
                    reporting and visualisation for the client project manager I supported.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Beyond client work, my project supervisor gave me opportunities to help out at the client account level and with the Singapore Financial Services practice. 
                    I was also given the chance to organise and prepare event logistics when organising events for the Accenture team on the project, besides chasing the team for time sheets every week. 
                    I loved the guidance and autonomy my supervisor provided me during those two years.
                </li>

            </li>
            <li>Side Projects at Accenture
                <p>On the side, I found out more about the different services Accenture offers to clients to explore where I
                    would be a best fit, and also explored ways to grow my skills outside my daily work. Therefore, I participated in</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grow my skills or a community
                        <ol>
                          <li><b>Accenture Coach and Be Coached Program</b> - I practised how to coach someone, while getting coached by someone else from an Accenture office outside of Singapore over 2 cycles</li>
                          <li><b>Accenture Singapore Liquid Studio Proof of Concept</b> - I developed process flows as part of a proof of concept using the IBM Blueworks BPM platform</li>
                          <li><b>Accenture Mental Health Ally Singapore Community</b> - One of 5 co-founders (Stephanie Gault, Pavan Sethi, Leong Jie Min, Daniel Flynn, and I) who launched the Mental Health Ally Singapore Community in 2018 customised for an Asian context to create a supportive community and fill the gap in resources to support mental wellness in the Singapore office.
                            Then I planned and executed events as part of the comms team since 2018. 
                            Our efforts were recognised by Accenture awarding us the 2019 ASEAN Greater Than Award (Community category).
                            As we extended the community to the Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand offices in 2021 and 2022, I helped out with gathering content to update the design of the internal Mental Wellness webpages.
                            This required me to work with the comms team lead, a Singapore webpage designer, the Mental Health Ally committee from the respective countries and WordPress developers from the Philippines and Buenos Aires</li>

                          <li><b>Accenture Development Partnerships Case Competition</b> - I researched and proposed exploring partners which could work together to solve the problem of malaria, from engaging medical centres on the ground to secure ways to share data with teams running machine learning models to speed up diagnosis and treatment of malaria</li>
                          <li><b>Accenture Digital Skills UKI Artificial Intelligence FutureLearn Course</b> - I mentored 2 cycles of learners in 2020 and 2011 by helping them with questions they asked, giving them readings to improve their understanding of what AI can do, understood and discussed what their concerns were with AI. 
                            This was a way I could give back to the community after learning what I learned about AI within and outside of Accenture</li>
                          <li><b>Accenture Responsible AI Practice</b> - Desk research on the Responsible AI narrative in Singapore to help 2 US Responsible AI Co-Leads prepare for their sharing sessions in Singapore at a financial services client, a General Assembly event and media outlets</li>
