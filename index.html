                <p>
                    My first two years at Accenture was with the Wealth Management arm of a Banking client. My focus was on project management, data cleaning,
                    reporting and visualisation for the client project manager I supported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond client work, my project supervisor gave me opportunities to help out at the client account level and with the Singapore Financial Services practice. I loved the guidance and autonomy during those two years.
                </p>
                <p>On the side, I found out more about the different services Accenture offers to clients to explore where I
                    would be a best fit, and also explored ways to grow my skills outside my daily work. Therefore, I participated in
                    <ol>
