              I wish to explore:
              <ol>
                  <li>How tensorflow works for a classification problem</li>

          <h3>2. Rocket Academy Basics</h3>
          <p>
             I completed the Rocket Academy Basics training from February to April 2022 to improve my computational thinking using JavaScript.
             We has pre-class readings and practices, lectures and in-class practices where we practised pair programming with a fellow classmate.
             We also completed some short projects on our own, and reached out to our instructors or fellow classmates if we needed help.
             These projects include:
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaiquanmah/a-simple-petals-tf-2-2-notebook" target="_blank">This project</a> is done as part of my week 8 assignment of the <a href="eacambridge.org/technical-alignment-curriculum" target="_blank">AGI Safety training</a> where I want to deepen my understanding of a deep learning algorithm applied to a problem. 
              <ol>
                  <li>Scissors, Paper Stone - Single-player game against the computer. The intention of this assignment was to become comfortable with writing if-else statements in JavaScript and refactoring code into smaller, maintainable functions. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project1-sps/script.js" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href="https://kaiquanmah.github.io/basics-14-real/project1-sps/index.html" target="_blank">webpage</a></li>
                  <li>Beat That - Two-player game where each player has 2 random dice rolls, choose their first and second numbers, then compare which player's number is the highest. The intention of this assignment was to become more comfortable working with mutable (let) and immutable (const) variables, and continue practising on if-else statements. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project2-beat-that/script.js" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href="https://kaiquanmah.github.io/basics-14-real/project2-beat-that/index.html" target="_blank">webpage</a></li>
                  <li>Blackjack - Single-player game against the computer. The intention of this assignment was to become more comfortable working with customising for different stages/modes of a game based on a user's action, showing relevant buttons during the game, customising the background colour, font and adding images. Refer to the code (<a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project3-blackjack/index.html" target="_blank">HTML</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project3-blackjack/styles.css" target="_blank">CSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/KaiquanMah/basics-14-real/blob/main/project3-blackjack/script.js" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>) and <a href="https://kaiquanmah.github.io/basics-14-real/project3-blackjack/index.html" target="_blank">webpage</a></li>

          <h3>3. DataCamp Data Analyst Case Study</h3>
          <p>
             As part of the DataCamp Data Analyst certification assessment, I completed an interesting case study to increase readership by 75% in 1 year for the marketing department of a fictitious company - 'Nearly New Nautical'.
             This was a case study with analysis performed using Python in a Jupyter notebook, a slide deck and a recorded presentation (accessible only by the DataCamp assessors).
             The case study was interesting as I got a glimpse into the different boat designs while creating the slide deck.
             Please reach out to me personally if you would like to view the Jupyter notebook analysis and slide deck.

                    Beyond client work, my project supervisor gave me opportunities to help out at the client account level and with the Singapore Financial Services practice. 
                    I was also given the chance to organise and prepare event logistics when organising events for the Accenture team on the project, besides chasing the team for time sheets every week. 
                    I loved the guidance and autonomy my supervisor provided me during those two years
